10. Reinforcement Learning in Sports

Reinforcement learning (RL) is learning what to do by trying and taking the next action based on the reward 

Unlike other methods in machine learning that rely on models, reinforcement learning starts with an agent , seeking to achieve his goal by interactively trying and receiving a reward signal for his actions. The environment receives actions and emits rewards, numerical values indicating how good agent’s actions were.

Even the tools in reinforcement learning sound like sports: with names and terms like gym, coach, actor-critic, and training, any sport data scientist can find many useful applications in reinforcement learning methods.
Reinforcement learning is an area of unsupervised learning that emerged from dynamic programming, game theory, theory of control, and models based on Markov decision process. While there’re many methods and algorithms in reinforcement learning: Deep Q Networks (DQN), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG), Generative Adversarial Limitation Learning (GALL), and various implementations of actor-critic (A2C) are the most popular
